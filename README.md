# PAI
PAI is a program written in C. This was my first project done while I was in 10th standard.

> This app was developed when we did not had computer in our house. We had extra curricular classes as Computer subject in my town in my school. I joined these classes and whenever I am doe with teachers assignment, I worked on this project and some other C projects.

Please keep in mind that this is written by me back when Computers were not populer in my town and only my school had 10 computers in our whole town. I was just learning the computer languages. I wanted to have orignal program here so I did not changed anything however foolish it may sound

- PAI is written in C language which is basically early database of sentences.
- I have incorporated trial and paid mode in this also, For paid version user can set password which is stored in "base.obb" file and for creating OTP is required which is generated through an algorithm.
- OTPs are stored in OTP.txt file that is generated by program
- Database is stored in "file.obb"
- If value is found it returns values if not found it asks for input answers you want to display and stores inside local file
